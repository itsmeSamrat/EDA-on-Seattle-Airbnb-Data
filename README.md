## Description

In this project, we will look into the Airbnb listing associated with the Seattle area. It will help us to discover a few key aspects of the Airbnb renting scene in Seattle. We have three dataset: Listing, Calender, and Reviews. We will be answering following research questions:

1. Does the price change with features like the host being super host, neighborhood, property type, and room type?
2. How does the price range vary throughout the year? Can we detect any seasonal pattern for the pricing of the place?
3. How did people feel after their stay?

Thank for stopping by. ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
